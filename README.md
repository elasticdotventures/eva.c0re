EV Assistant Public Core

this repository will *eventually* hold all public artificats of Elastic.Ventures
for now, only the jargon file.  To make this easy; I've put everything into the master
branch. 

@pokey, @margaret - 
I will demo some of these pieces tomorrow in our meeting; but it might be helpful if you can follow along.   

to access the vue-intranet-app here are the basic requirements/instructions
please see how far you can get; i'm not going to be able to write out every click
but I'll try to provide a list 

## download and install #pretty minimum toolchain
https://docs.google.com/document/d/16-Y4VVg4VisunWma03BY9ejK5zF_ete9o5r3ozFu-U0/edit#

* you'll need some command prompt or unix shell. 

## clone this github repo to your computer
- go into the vue-intranet-app
- first time: ```npm i``` : will download and install any missing libraries. 
- then: ```npm run serve ``` : a webserver will start on your PC; then you can access the site  from a browser
- or ```npm run lint ``` : performs a basic syntax check
- or ```npm run storybook:serve``` : runs the storybook (not finished)
