# eva.c0re repo

## 🚀EV Public c0re dump

😁 this repository will *eventually* hold all public artificats, 
components, modules, and links to libraries for public facing documentation of http://Elastic.Ventures

💀 The repo uses the same naming format as the Google Drive #eva folder; and confidential information.
It may not be used in a commercial product, but you are free to use for personal use. 

GIThub.com is owned by Microsoft, the GIT protocol is an open source library that is implemented in a variety
of methods within hundreds of thousands of different software applications and is the internal file sharing
and revision control system for ~98% of the servers on the Internet.  GIT has a well deserved reputation as being
extremely difficult to learn, this is because so many tools implement different features of GIT differently. 

Organizationally this repo contains a toolchain (in development) with installation instructions and scripts
to configure the EV Toolchain.   The EV Toolchain provides all the instructions; a current snapshot of EV 
technology for someany who is evaluating or intends to contribute.  The GIT library is embedded into Visual
Studio Code; and so the first step to getting started is to download the toolchain, or at least parts of
the toolchain and get the tests to run (or start building tests where there are none).

EV's goal is to ultimately end up writing our own GIT tutorial; both explaining GIT for n00bs (new users, see [jargon.md]);
with some variances on a per-channel by channel basis. 
dividing big pieces of technology into their own repos in the form of libraries.

to access Google Drive. If you don't want EV tools to access your own Google documents; 
then consider setting up a separate account for EV ventures.
