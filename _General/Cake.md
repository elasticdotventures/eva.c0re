# LEGAL

This repository; is document is an artifact of the Elastic.Ventures CYBER-CORPORATION in creating corporation
governence and equity distribution based on blockchain smart-contracts; 
with built in employee participation equity incenvization "convertable equity". 
This is HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL. 

EV will allow limited auditing; and plans to offer audited financials in the future.  As yei see it
:cake: is a flexible bonus and incentivization; measuring deferred gratification and contribution attribution royalty tracking system.  Employees and contractors are paid a base salary and receive a highly flexible bonus structure which can be rolled over and is tracked in a ledger format. 

# DEFINITIONS
* :emoji
| sequences of words appear in this document; they are intended to represent a thought or concept. 
* #channel. 
| denotes a slack channel; each channel has a 'charter' that determines how the channel operates. This repo stores data for each _Channel in it's respective directory.

# ü§ì :yei:

The term "yei" represents EV company #human labor; in a collective social contract between labor and the company.  A participant in :cake: is automatically part of the yei.  Yei is collectively organized as humans and intelligent robotics who work on tasks on behalf of the company and interatively improve together by exchanging tasks. :cake: represents food for a #human or "fuel" for a robot. 

Any task which is repetitive can probably be automated.  :cake: will be given to encourage yei to work with engineers to design better processes that increase our :ubuntu: and more value for :cake: as a team initiative; and also as an internal point based reward system. 

see: [jargon.md]

# üç∞ :cake:
is a peer recognition and goal incentivization system 
that is implemented in our _Eva_bot; and used as an organization wide
stakeholder decision making tool.  Yei (EV, contracts, and partners)
track :cake: across topics as a 'goal or reward' which is distributed
in a similar fashion to a 'tip' or 'gratuity'.  Humans are social 
creatures; and action which does not receive positive feedback from 
peers will ultimately cease. 

# :ubuntu: 
:ubuntu: is a concept; the entire planet - as global village; 
collectively a metric EV tracks for our charity initiatives and consulting efforts.
Each individual doing their part to make the village we all share better.  
EV ubuntu extends to cyberspace. 

# Ballast
Every project should have a few ballast spots in a charter for a #channel.  
Ballast positions basically have no role or assigned tasks except for bearing witness.
Ballast can participate; but nothing is expected or assigned to ballast. 
Ballast yei are not compensated; it is considered good form to allocate 1% of the distribution (1 out of every 100 shares) toward ballast.  The 1% will be divided among ALL yei ballast
(organizationallyei)

# Universal Income "Living Wage"

Rather than a top-down hiearchy like many companies EV is optimized for asychronous communication and collaboration.  Each human or intelligent machine "yei" is an important part of a process in developing robotics and artificial intelligence.   For this reason all employees are paid the same base salary.  This various by city/region and state but is tracked as the average salary of a first year primary school teacher. 

Yei also encourage members of our crews to work with other crew members to build consensus and provide detailed updates.  :cake: is the reward system; and :turkey: is the equivalent metric for a failure. :cake: is managed in the #red_team "Captains" channel; alongside the #ubuntu program.

# Captains 
Per the pirate code; Channel captains get 1 extra 'share' or vote for being team captain. 
The goal is to turn over a lot of the captain roles to automation early in our
organizational pattern.   (Yei need to build that first) and not adhere to a traditional 
top down management system; rather an internally elected leadership. 

EV see's itself as a combination of Hewlett Packard meets East India Trading Co. and each individual yei is a pirate;  in terms of organization and accounting the term "shares" is used interchangibly with :cake:;  but a :cake: does not represent a share in the company; rather shares of an elastic project venture.    

# How does the Organization Pay? 
* For contractors; and invoice EV at your agreed upon rate; provided there is at least one :cake: received per 10 hours or get a special waiver. Please note :cake: can be obtained
in various channels by sharing details about yourself with other yei. 

* For Partnerships/JV's: Standard invoicing; :cake: points are simply metrics EV uses to internally identify and recognize our outstanding vendors.

* For employees: ZenPayroll represents a regular draw; with bonus "payout" seasonal holidays (3 per year) to redeem cake. 

The eligibility of certain redemptions such as travel, access to company ATM cards "budgets",
things like that are secured with :cake:, additionally things like health care plans the 
cake 



# What happens to my :cake: when I leave?
You cannot own :cake:; or receive :cake:.  there are no :cake: coins; :cake: are points; they exist in cyberspace. yei can accumulate points. 
yei can trade the points for cash and prizes.
:cake: rates are established by the board of directors based on the pool of cash available at various holidays seasons (roughly ~4 seasons; winter, spring, summer, & fall) and are administered by EV #governance (board of directors) appointed advisors.  
Roughly $0.01 per point. 


# How does EV make money? 

EV receives a royalty, commission, or other payment for services rendered or products sold.  These are then disbursed inside the company to various projects hosted in #channels. 

New projects are owned or co-owned by their captains and co-captains; for their respective team in terms of both size and value to the organization.

In this way; departments are expected to be continually showing positive growth in efficiency; mission capability; or revenue based on that departments individual goals.  This is not the responsibility of one individual yei "captain"; but that persons responsibility is inflated as is their ownership of the project (and the possible resulting stench of failure).  

In some cases we can redefine these to claiming they were "experiments" instead of "projects"; and experiments can have successful failures.  The idea behind :cake: is to measure a successful failure; but still be able to reward a success. 

Channels will need to justify their inputs, outputs, and budgets as we complete our research education delivery cycle.  

Rather 10% of the EV company is reserved for what we internally refer to currently as "coco-founder" :cake: and the value of the company; based on last funding rounds resets the value of :cake:; all cake currently issued is coco-founder cake.  

#AllTheCake
Ways to get paid: 
* Invoicing: You invoice EV;  reimbursements for materials are separate. No :cake: value. :cake: is for metrics only.
* Salary:  Yei salary is always based on the start salary of a primary school teacher in your state/district.  This confers an employment, or minimum invoice if you are a contractor. Generally this based on some universal
income score. 
* Bonus:  A bonus; commonly 30% is available for performance. 
We call this the "reality check"; :cake: performance metrics, including historical data may determine bonsuses.
* Royalty:  This is an ongoing fixed or mathematical formula to measure technical contributions; special merit royalties from the :cake: fund.  The :cake: fund manages disbursement for royalties. 
* Dividend:  A payment 
* Equity Sale: 
* Ubuntu:  10% of yei operating budget is available for charity. 

  The value of the :cake: will be based on the companies 
internal value; and it may change wildly - yei will update this as often as necessary; but at least once per year at the annual board meeting.  

As a rule; buy low; sell high is the best market strategy. 


# Beta note:
the @eva software to process blockchain.log and :cake: are still in development while we determine
the needs of the mvp.  In that sense at the moment cake is a tracked number; but fictionally 
assigned by peers - so :cake: could be conceived as "manager and peer review" but gives a
:yes: or :no: signal. 

# TL;DR -- Executive Summary
:cake: itself is a business unit metric of Elastic.Ventures; a measurement or points system. A positive signal.
:cake: represents a micro-step in a transaction or task; it should be given after any confirmation of any requested action is performed properly.  
:cake: points are kept on a ledger within this repo in a file "blockchain.log" that records our contributions and organizations. 
:cake: the value of cake to each individual varies based on their skills; i.e. cake points are actually worth
their channel.  
:cake: will be tracked by both the channel, and individual.  Complex objectives designed to stimulate the 
overachiever. 
:cake: has many long term goals including a better system for initiative attribution and rewarding positive feedback.  
:cake: should be given as a tip, gratuity or bonus based on an agreement between individuals or a #channel toward either personal, team #channel, or organizational goals.  It should never be given for a task that was not performed (but could be given for failures; in a research context)

A class of stock inside Elastic.Ventures known as "convertible equity"; 
10% of the shares the company will remain the property of the yei; :cake: shares. 

Cake is "earned" by completing microtasks "bounties" and sharing giving :cake: emojiflair to others.
If you give :cake: you also get it, but a 1/100th fraction of a piece the "frosting rate".

RULE: If yei give :cake:; yei get 1/200th "frosting" :cake: back. 
RULE: @eva can be access for scores.  She will notify each cake up to 10; then every 10 until 100, then every 100 until a 1000; etc. 

Staff receives 05% APR interest on :cake:; that is far cheaper than our 

All channels currently have the same frosting rate; any logs put into the blockchain.log post 
2019050100000 will receive 1% back; effectively cakes given * 1/100;  on a monthly basis.

:cake: represents opportunity; if yei see :cake: in a document; contribute there! then post in 
slack chat; yei will receive cake for that (provide yei were helpful).  

yei #humans man have minimum and maximum amounts of cake they may earn based on their job class. 
I.e. "yei've earned yei cake for the day".  At this point; simply by protocol this number is currently 1 cake per day per channel can be accumulated. 

If yei choose to waste yei time on cheap :cake: which doesn't have a lot of value; then that is up to you.
Yei :cake: rate is negotiated per channel in terms of dollars; and that departments ownership of the entire 
company based on the value. 

Structurally; the EV organization attempts to structure 30% operations & manufacturing #ops;  30% engineering #prototypes; and 30% sales and marketing #salesviking #pretty;  however this may change as our headcount does.
Right now the company is in a growth phase; growing from 3 people to approximately 10-15 consultants and
advisers who may be participating in the :cake: game. 

As the headcount changes; then we will change the system to reward more efficiency through automation in
terms of daily tasks; and rewarding consistent performance or growth.  In that sense cake allows us to 
set clear metrics for an employee in terms of week to week activities based on organizationally what we need at that moment. 

Jobs it github issues may have many cake associated with them.  In some cases objectives for an individual developer might be as simple as "earn cake"; or "if you can solve xyz problem; we'll double the amount of :cake:" yei can earn that month.   

An individual yei; may subscribe to up 10 channels; with allocations in terms of time per week based on a 69-70 hour week possible based on current planetary restrictions.   This requires people to post a commitment in terms 
of time and focus on the channels projects; and for the other members of the channel to acknowledge that 
individuals contribution to the collective yei.  If a yei subscribes to more than 10 channels; they shall 
only be allowed to participate in 10 during the holiday festivals.  Different channels may celebrate different holidays differently.

The value of each :cake: and cash-out protocols vary by channel.  It is assumed that one cake roughly represents $1 USD or $1 EURO; or "unit" of measure; but again - it is important to remember that a :cake: is a point.
A point might be worth $1 USD and $1 EURO at the same time; depending on which account it came out of. 

To keep things simple for now; it's all one big :cake: ledger in #general 
but we expect it to become more specialized in the future. 


#holidays
Holiday festivals currently include Christmas-New Year, Spring Festival (Lunar March), and Festivus (June); when :cake: may be converted into cash and equity.  In some countries; such as China we will be required to organizationally withhold 30% of an employees salary for bonus or possibly medical emergencies. 

In general; the headcount of a department will be considered the vote for that department on the overall company charter.  Currently there are three departments #ops; #salesvikings; #prototypes; so the headcount of 3.

#equity
The assumption is that a special class of founders, co-founder, coco-founder equity would be set aside to reward people.  Generally speaking as an employee at this stage; you should expect us to provide you enough in bonus and
compensation structure to buy a house; or travel extensively (while saving for a house) realistically within 3 years.   However depending on how yei interact with :cake: yei could be parking a nissan or a ferrari; so this is very much participate at your own risk. 

#red_team
The :cake: points represent an individual account in an internal company #parrrtyfund channel for travel and study and career advancement opportunities in between project cycles.  The #parrrtyfund is managed by the #red_team. 





# Complicated Employment Contracts
Understanding :cake: is the key to understanding an EV employment offer. 

Anybody participating in :cake: get's the same salary - which is determined by your residence.
We use the average starting pay of an elementry school teacher in your region.   
Everybody gets paid the same; even @b.  This is determined by HR and reviewed once per year.
Base Pay is increased in line with minimum teach union wages; generally speaking 3% annually. 

https://www.niche.com/blog/teacher-salaries-in-america/
The rest of the pay is made up in an Eastern Chinese way of thinking; in that bonuses will be paid
based on your holiday; or organizational holidays.  :cake: represents a ledger you can add to and 
cash out during the holiday periods. 

# Participation
Participation in the :cake: is completely optional. 
To participate in :cake: you must agree to the EV SMA NDA v20181010 or later.

Cake "convertible equity" is avaiable to employees, paid consultants and advisors. 
Opportunities to convert :cake: into either compensation or other type of employee stock 
ownership (ESOP) vehicle in the future. 

# How to Earn :cake:
To receive :cake:; you must give at least one :cake: per tick cycle to another person 
in EV Slack Chat in a channel where :cake: is being tracked by @eva or @b;
Currently it is stored in the eva.core repo and manually updated by participants 
and is described in detail below. 

the :cake: emoji-flair is 'shared' in Slack chat by peers for completing tasks on time; 
or curating useful content or feedback; this is currently tracked manually and recorded in
(blockchain.log) but will be recorded by the @eva (a slack bot under development) at some 
point in the future to simplify record keeping. 

# @eva
A brief note about @eva the system is design as a centralized assistant that maintains records 
and coordinates disbursements (or in some cases reimbursements); including payroll &
bonus systems which are tied to company performance quality metrics; as well as a variety of other
record keeping and alarm notifications.

:cake: bounties rewards will be created from todo tasks; github issues; slack messages; in google docs; etc. 
an individual gets :cake: by participating; and also for acknowledging somebody who has participated. 
This is called "collective incentivization";

# Saving :cake:
the :cake: money grows inside the company; which can be converted to equity or for incentives. 
:cake: can be bonused into cash or prizes before holiday periods and used as internal EV company credit and
access system.  :cake: can be used; but only at the travel class. 

# Getting Paid
the board of directors of EV will designate polices related to this; individually at this point. 

# How to see your Score
Look at (blockchain.log) and see references for your name. 
We hope to have @eva the chatbot online which will provide score updates and metrics. 

# How to Give Cake
Anybody may give :cake:; but only if they have some;  somebody with a lot of :cake:; will give 
more cake than somebody with no cake;  each person who has :cake: receives additional cake based 
on their role for giving it. 

# Specific Tasks
The following is a list of tasks that will earn :cake: from @eva; 

* Join slack #general; get mentioned (and introduce yourself)
* Visit some place that he's been in #travel and post a picture
* Upload your southpark emoji
* Introduce yourself in #general to everybody
* Add yourself to the team directory
* Complete an assigned /todo task from @b

# How to Vote (yei will be contacted in slack; or other messaging app)
The mechanisms for voting, equity, and balance sheets are maintained by the company secretary.
Generally speaking - you need some :cake: first; then you get one vote for having a :cake:; 
and another vote for each :cake:.   Each :cake: represents a vote about the direction. 

# How to Wager
TODO - at this point the ability to wager :cake: points with your peers is a planned feature. 

# @eva bounties
@eva tracks the :cake:; and therefore can give exactly 1 cake point.
These are actions which will result in @eva giving an emoji flair bounty to the post.

# Events
* Holiday Event
any of the following situations: more than $50k0 USD in funding; more than $1m USD in gross merchandise sales;

# What if you are a digital nomad like @tamara
For digital nomads with no implicit region - the base salary is determined by HR but is indexed to the price of a school teacher in the country, city state, you attended your 1st day of first school.  BUT if you stay any place for more than 120 days concurrently you need to register in that country. ;-) 
we can also average; it's a flexible rule. 

# why is :cake: locked to certain minimum/maximums
This is an experimental game; these types of programs are very new. It limits our liability; 
we want to encourage automation in job roles;  so encouraging people to find better ways to do their job
with automation is a big part of what yei are about here at EV. 

# FAQ: What happens with :cake: is hacked?
The ledger will be backed up across two clouds; and screenshots images will be made with date-stamps that are googles responsibility. 

# Cyber E-verything
All our corporate documents have been put on the cloud.  We are still getting them reviewed; making 
internal corporate governance much easier and giving everybody a 'cycle based' assessment of the company.
