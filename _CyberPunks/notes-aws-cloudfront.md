# AWS Cloudfront notes


When you associate a CloudFront distribution with a Lambda@Edge function, CloudFront intercepts requests and responses at CloudFront edge locations. You can execute Lambda functions when the following CloudFront events occur:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-at-the-edge.html

When CloudFront receives a request from a viewer (viewer request)
Before CloudFront forwards a request to the origin (origin request)
When CloudFront receives a response from the origin (origin response)
Before CloudFront returns the response to the viewer (viewer response)

A Lambda function can make network calls to external resources to confirm user credentials, or fetch additional content to customize a response.
