*** ROCKET NOTES: 
I've written books on Linux, was among the first 10,000 users, hung out with Linus (the
Author) as a 16 year old (he was 19), contributed substantially over the years to the adoption 
efforts, and wrote roughly 95% of the questions for the first commercial open-certification exam. 
(It was necessary in government to have certifications for establishing vendor standards, so 
my focus was on creating Linux jobs so people could get employed-paid to contribute). Most of my code
contributions and patches to the NFSv1 & 2 subsystem, the author-maintainer didn't accept much, 
but appreciated the bug reports. Modern Linux is very differnt than what I worked on, but the IoT
versions on a RaspberryPI IoT are orders of magnitude faster than my first 80486 Linux servers were.
