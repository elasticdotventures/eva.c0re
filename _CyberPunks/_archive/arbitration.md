Providing design, execution, #datapunk metrics, monitoring, and support of EV software. 
How can yei best codify our obligations to other departments and ultimately customers?

# Harrumph, Point of Order! 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure

In the 16th and 17th century, there were rules of order in the early Parliaments of 
England.[3] In the 1560s Sir Thomas Smyth began the process of writing down accepted 
procedures and published a book about them for the House of Commons in 1583.[3] Early 
rules included

* One subject should be discussed at a time (adopted 1581)[3][4]
* Personal attacks are to be avoided in debate (1604)[3]
* Debate must be limited to the merits of the question (1610)[3]
* Division of a question when some seem to be for one part but not the other (1640)[3]




# Recording Failures
Keep logs of our failures; outages with explanations.

# Updating Documentation
``@eva# yei get one :cake: for 'significant' contributions``

# PagerDuty: On "Watch" Policy
``@eva# yei get one :cake: for every day; if yei was on watch``

# Projects
``@eva# yei get one :cake: for every bug yei squash; ``

Anytime, anybody on a team i'm on, feels they are being personally attacked, for 
any reason, do we stop there and address that for a period of time, and if not it 
needs to be tabled and pushed forward. 

# Blackspot - Incompetence
Does somebodies code always break things?   Hate dealing with somebody who is really obnoxiously incompetent. 
Give them a blackspot; to suggest their removal from the team roster; or ballast list. 

# Blackspot - Trolls & Bully's
To clarify: a blackspot is not a threat; or a tool.  
Yei send the blackspot to @eva who will anonymously deliver the blackspot. 
// logs; can blackspots be anonymized?

Yei strive for a zero-hostility work environment, because nobody wants that type of angst. 
Studies have shown that infighting causes caustic damage to team momentum. 
As such EV has a zero tolerance for this type of behavior. 
first, 1 warning;  90 day reset. 
second, cake zero; 
third, termination.  
Punishment: Fines or Termination.


why 'point of order' to write down (document) some of our beliefs. 

To this extent I propose one of our first official actions to be declaring Friday
a 'holy day' which we use, in part, to resolve issues like this that may have happened
throughout the week.


anybody should be able to 'call to order' (or some such mechanism) with such specific
verbiage as to be understood by the other members of the team, that the person,
in this case me, is in the minority, and has specific concerns and is asking for
a discussion period, and the rules of that, should be more specifically defined.

the point of this silly procedure, and in my opinion it should be silly fun --
that would hopefully become part of our culture, and eventually (if successful) be
exported to other teams, is to make sure each member is producing at their highest
level possible, and understands the expectations and personal feelings are removed.

when we are here, at work, we are to behave like robots programmed to create the 
best product and service. the 'best' code, on time.

code should be designed, so it is easily torn out.
write loosley coupled, highly cohesive code.
