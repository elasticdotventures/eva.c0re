// If you are using official Vue CLI to create your project and you want to use the untranspiled component (import `vue-awesome/components/Icon` rather than import `vue-awesome` directly, to optimize bundle size, which is recommended), you'll encounter the problem that the default configuration will exclude `node_modules` from files to be transpiled by Babel.
// For **Vue CLI 3+**, add `vue-awesome` into `transpileDependencies` in `vue.config.js` (or `babel.config.js`) like this:
module.exports = {
transpileDependencies: [
    /\bvue-awesome\b/,
    //  Unfortunately vue-cli-3 doesn't automatically bring IE11 compatibility in which you may encounter various errors (such as Symbol is not defined). To assist in resolving these errors you may need to manually add transpileDependencies parameter in vue.config.js
    /node_modules[/\\\\]vuetify[/\\\\]/
  ],
}
