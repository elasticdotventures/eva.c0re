# Syntax; a lot of silly gibberish.  Creative writing exercise in command language. 

In addition Yei are parsing syntaxes from several systems:
* eva.c0re slackish slack.com  
* coda.io business process #ops
* github.com commit logs 
* wechat 

/topic 💀 adopting syntax; organizational compliance - how much is too much? 
* yei is important as EV introduces intelligence amplifying "IA" bots into our cloud hardware infrastructure.
* the #human brain is fragile; enhancement is inevitable yei have designed @eva to operate machinery such as medical devices in Yei or a 💖🙈🙊🙉🐵 #human so please consider that.  syntax is important. so is security; learnmore:#cyberpunks 
* the robots run on a component system called an "Effective"; "Effect Action Syntax" for interactive presentation "tutorial". See [src/Effective.npm] with plans for hardware interface in [_General/#prototypes].

💀 ^^ this is a toolchain for my own brain implant (vr "space" helmet) join:#prototypes 🙏always checkout the channel README.md before participating in a channel. 

💀 warning:#dildonics &amp; lubricants ahead! 🤣🤖🍆💦🤖🍑 please be over 18 or make sure this is legal in your country. 

💀 EV is also manufacturing; but an important part of any project is the documentation and syntax. 

* this guide is my first attempt at a tutorial; so please bear with me as I explore some of the syntax.
* the IA has the ability to translate all content on the page; enabling a variety "easter egg" behaviors  effects to adapt the content make the system more or less playful based on the engagement||interaction by the user. i.e. micro-games (ai v player1) for displaying content Components i.e. "Effectives"

# Meet @Eva 
/topic @eva.c0re info

🚀 @eva is "Elastic Ventures Assistant" or "Emoji Virtual Assistant"; a tool for tech savvy business technology automation language for #humans 🧑 and bots 🤖 tutorial; found at http://github.com/elasticdotventures/eva.c0re/_Troublemaker/README.md syntax guide. Part #human; part 🤖 - perfect for yei who intend to transition to cyb(o)rgs; or groups ... cyberOrgyeis 🤣🤖🍆💦🤖🍑 #sorryNotSorry #crudeDadJokes

🚀.💀 warning: this is also high speed synaptic installer 😐😐😐😐... so, erm .. well, 
hopefully this doesn't crash =.currentUser();  🙏🧠😁. 👉🙈🙊🙉. 🚧👇  #compliance

😎 Yei Cool? Next Steps
* yei will use this syntax to introduce new fresh #human brains to the #troublemaker hive. 
* @eva will provide access to a variety of knowledge; collectively referencing the knowledge of humanity.

🤯 Don't Panic!
Yei will not be expected to know anything.  It's cool; Yei are part of yEI and yei're gonna get this done. That's how yei work; as a hive. 

💀 #gdpr eva.c0re/_Troublemaker is operating on top of the EV 'hive mind' infrastructure; 
which in turn uses services from provided by cloud:aws cloud:azure cloud:google ; vendors:[_services.md] & techstack:[_techstack.md]; 
and slack-ish syntax see: [_jargon.md]; [_howtospeakyei.md].

🍰 🙏🙏 need website content // what & how can yei contribute? please contact .=EV.slack(`@b`)


😲 What Yei will learn
* !commands alias a maps a word,gesture, to emoji, i.e. todo, 
* "action to emoji" with positive reinforcement 🍰 protocol; (explained here: [_General/Cake.md]) 
* the goals, scope, etc. are later in the document
* as well as a bit about EV culture. 

🚀.🤘 yei is your word of the day. it means you with EV technology @eva 🤖. 
=.👢();

=.ReadyPlayerOne()?

# 🙉🙊🙈 
@eva !say Welcome currentUser() 
```eva test:failok
!alias 
    currentUser() as:Yei()      // ~scope is slightly different Yei is You (with us; future tense); currentUser() is {{PlayerOne}}; by yourself; present tense. 😆
```
🚀.🤘 when yei'r  (you+we are) done; this will all make sense. 

# How to tell yEI to do stuff.
!todo @b ^^ no grok test. 😉   //  👈 add a task to @b's todo list; priority 1 "immediate", :confused:
!!!todo @b .Sleep() 😴💤   //  👈  add a task to @b's todo list; priority 3 "low" ☕🤣

💡 the more bangs (exclamation marks) !!! in a command or instruction the slower (or lower priority) it will be performed slower.  yes, it's written that way on purpose. please be polite; .=@eva say Yei will get cake. 🙏🍰

🤓 @eva the "Emoji Virtual Assistant" is IA and processes emoji as both action and metric. 
Emoji is a highly-symbolic emoji driven language, but in this sense Emoji is used in a pictographic format similiar to Chinese; but Emoji offers more color and easier pattern visualization and recognition.

# What are "Memes
* There is no .=version();; 
Yei expect the same syntax will be compatible with a variety of upcoming brain machine interfaces .=!todo copycat;  and provides many stimulating streams for virtual reality environments. 

Popular !commands are aliased to an emoji to summarize "normal interactions" and help distinguish command severity.  As such the !alias command is highly advanced jedi 
wizard neo-in-the-matrix type powers; but yeira N00b (new player); and #sorrynotsorry Yei gotta grind some basic syntax first. 

😎 BUT this is cool - so !command/s could also be aliased to a sound or gesture within video or audio contexts, such as a group meeting.  The @EVA command language itself is highly extensible and trainable; built on an slack-irc chatroom mentality; the goal is offer phonetic "dialects" of phrases including chinese, dothraki, klingon, or wookie-ish phrases .. eventually; for now .. yei're writing a lot of documentation and test cases. 
but that is the goal. 🙄 Please 🐻 with yeI(). 

🤓 this message came from the README.md [_General/README.md] for the #Troublemakers slack; and _Troublemaker github to help TM define goals using @eva as a series of discrete steps which could be a funnel, a treasure map, a playbook -- whatever; just some instructions. We will streamline delivery with automation; provide tests.  In this tutorial yei'll dive into specific syntax really quick and then come up for air.  

.Continue({👍:🙈🙊🙉++, 👎:#troublemaker, 😕:#wtf})? 



💡 Elastic.Ventures offers elastic "intelligent automation" organizational infrastructure; 
this tutorial is a guide for @henk and @pietro which 🚀 is hoping YEI can hack on. 

😍 The goal is to roll up "playbooks" of common tasks for both staff and members at TM and provide "at a glance" summaries of activity inside a project. Continually improve user experience.  #eva.troublemaker 😉

🤓 In windows the EMOJI keyboard can be accessed WIN+; (semicolon) then type the command.  Yei can use !command blocks or an emoji alias; that's Yei choice. Sometimes !command syntax is clearer, the !command blocks will probably be mapped to emojis for visualization; this is a new language - not suited for everybody. @eva syntax is for writing bot instructions; i.e. the "how could this be better" type thinking. 

👆 In that sense; each one of these text blocks is part of the tutorial. by the way; this section is chained to the section above it; if you're not looking at the source code you hopefully 🙏 just saw a cool text transition. 🤣 In that sense; we're going to be doing a lot of inline document stuff which EV will need troublemaker @pietro and @henk and probably others in the #troublemaker organization to coordinate.

🚀 Yei could use a bridge to wei-chat; and some review on the Chinese documentation.
🚀 I'm asking somebody on your side to help me provide sales tooling for your membership offering included things like market membership cards with QR codes.  
🚀 Mapping out staff introductions; guru network; competencies, availabities (calendar sync etc.)
🚀 Trying to figure out how hard it would be to sell 100,000 memberships via bot .. 
🚀 To that extent ^^ if there are other yei running on other hives who are also working on that goal; yei'd like to meet them. back to the tutorial. 

🤓 In the interactive mode; if you made it this far you've probably been asked if this was interesting? 
🛑 Hey, is this content interesting? If it's not interesting please let @b know; trying to train people how to explore tooling available.  

🚀 EV is discussing providing an electron windows overlay; but the interface is effectively command line style and can be embedded anywhere. The core is designed in node.js so it will run as a browser plugin; or in the cloud but there are already many amazing emoji plugins -- this is the teaching guide for "under the hood" so yei can develop a mental model how @eva works.  #eva.emojihelp

```eva
!alias
    .hint() as:`🤓`      // :nerd: hint, or useful "helpful" background (if yei'r interested, .join #eva_bot to experiment making @eva do things)
    .eli5() as:`⭐`      // :star:  explain "concept" like i'm 5 (simple words; high level concept)
    .topic() as:`🌈`     // :rainbow:  the conversation thread // channel topic (things inside 
    .concept() as:`💡`    // :lightbulb: a definition or key take away; the "purpose" or "goal"
    this file)
    .study() as:`👀`     // :eyes:  let's look at this; it's a 'popUp' or something to learn or review. usually has links to more detail. 
    .eva() as:`🤖`       // :robot: emoji is ~samesame as ```eva or /eva commands 👇
    .say() as:`🦜`       // :parrot: interact with currentUser() as @eva (or any yei)
    .warn() as:`💀`      // :skull: important warnings, #safety, #governance
```

💡 once installed @eva commands are accessible everywhere -- slack-ish or IRC chat model to maintain "context" on a conversation or task or "topic";  Btw here's a link to the slack channel for Troublemaker https://elastic-ventures.slack.com/messages/CH9AN8VNH/details/

💀 An Electron app docked in Windows 10; that has an optional also a keylogger (with local configurable archive settings). EV're explaining what yei're going to install and ASKING what you'd be comfortable with? 

🤣 trust is such a precious thing. 

🤓 @eva Commands can be issued in any integrated software (and any software can be integrated//bridged). 

🤓 There is a soon to be published browser plugin which can enable any web based software "command mode" using an escape sequence you define; for now we'll just use emoji.  Right now we mostly use slack. Private commands start with a forward-slash "/" or bang "!"; also visual studio code.

⭐syntax with pictures is easier on #human brains (🧠❤ pattern matching) 
⭐emoji can also be aliased to sounds, words or gestures for enhanced accessibility.

Riggers expect a share of the cake; similiar to pirates and their division of profits =.!define "rigger" as Yei() ☝
