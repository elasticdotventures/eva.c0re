License EVD-1

Hi Hackernews; 
This license is in response to the 10x engineer conversation; and recent state of the planet in terms of nationalism
and fasiscm which are on the rise.  The worlds richest men are heading for space and our doomsday clock is only a few 
minutes from midnight as we enter the dawn of neuromorphic computing with self-installing robotics.  
Fake news is about to turn into fake audio, video, and CRISPR gene edited humans are now living amongst us. 

This is designed to fix some of the trolling and nationalist amplification platforms.

The EVD license is in development, as the software becomes more useful

About the Author:
ðŸš€ Hi, I'm @b; or "Rocket" to many of my friends. Friendly computer guy, with a background in testing early open-source software
and designing cloud scale API's.  I've recently gotten in hardware, and electronic and sensor design. 

I've been doing Internet stuff for about 28 years (age 43 now); licensed tax-paying computer IT consultant since age 13 grew up in 
a California farm town with muggle parents and learned technology on my own through reading; and early 1994 Internet access. 
Security, encryption and distributed computing were my childhood interests (31337 h4x04 sc1pt k1dd3). 
I'm one of the white, male, born in American "smart" people who have left the US as a digital nomad 
travelling to 44 countries in the past 3 years. 

I currently study the arts of cooking, engineering, mechantronics, and AI.  I speak 6 languages at various degrees
of fluency. I don't see myself as a 10x; althought I love what I do so I try to do it better than everybody and that isn't always
well understood. I've won lots of first-to-flag challenges and been a paid technology consultant to a variety of companies such as
Amazon, eBay, Paypal, FedEx, and a few others. 

I currently live in Australia with my girlfriend.  We all share the same planet; I'm developing the EV tool chain to run my own
automation and intelligence amplification devices.

Additionally global companies like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos are focused on leaving
the planet rather than trying to fix it and create a better world should be reminded that spending an equal amount of 
money trying to fix the current system is probably the best course of action.  So I'm suggesting that conscious consumerism.
