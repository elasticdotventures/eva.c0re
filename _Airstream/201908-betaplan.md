#Airstream Beta 

roughly a golfball; outer color is plastic dimples "fish eye" portals approximately 27.5cm in diameter; 
the fish eyes harvest additional sunlight for the 30cm hexagon shaped solar tiles underneath them. 

i'm not even going to think about the software yet; but for now we'll assume that each panel needs power.
on the roof there is a flat section .. around ~5ft x 600cm flat deck of reinforced panels with some marine boat 
connectors for tying down equipment on the roof. toward the middle the central heating system. 

the roof is accessible via the rear depending on the design. 
The shape of the vehicle is like a dented bullet case; but the rear pushes outward past the tail slightly.
    * !! caution this blocks the exit door which must be installed into the hexagon mesh. 
the romance theme is "recovered satellite"; fell of the moon; i dream of jeanie inside ('hippie privacy curtains') by my calculations 


along the edge of those

held together by a scaffolding.
undernearth the unit is vintage 2015 airstream 23d cloud body.
