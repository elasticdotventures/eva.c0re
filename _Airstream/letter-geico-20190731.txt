Memo RE: 
  * (G) Geico Case #
  * (P) Progressive #
  * (F) Foremost 
  * (EV) Elastic.Ventures #Airstream

Dear Geico, 

Geico holds a trietary policy on the caravan, underwritten by 
Foremost but purchased an administered through Geico.   

Geico is also my insurance company and I am disappointed that Geico 
is not accepting responsibility. 

We are in the process of notifying the trietary insurance Foremost,
which was sold via Geico. 

As such, this letter to 
Geico reflects some of my own thoughts as it pertains to "what 
I'd want my insurance company to do".  I look forward
to a discussion before we lawyer up.  Please don't close the case.

Please preserve any witness statements you may have, and will you 
please provide them for our review. 

Elastic.Ventures is requesting a secondary review of this case. 
Acknowledgement of responsibility in this accident from Geico. 

Your position is that your driver who:
 * admitted fault at the scene
 * was in a rental car, with a low-visible color. 
 * was cited by an officer for speeding & reckless driving. 
 * was passing in, and was in an improper lane position,
    * caused by improper passing manuevure (non-passing lane) by Geico driver
        * another drivers passing manuever had not been completed.
    * illegally using the gap established durings Ms. Woodfield's safe manuever
    * passing in the truck lane 
        * truck lane was reserved for Ms. Woodfield and EV Airstream, etc.
        * per NTSHA road-safety "rules of the road" [Driving & Lane Position]
        * causing the completion of Ms. Woodfields passing maneuvere
            * before the Geico driver could legally begin
            * as such; the time required for a safe passing manuevure
                * would necessitate the driver had followed "passed with"
                * and then proceeded to pass in the non-passing designated lane
                * resulting in 'improper lane position' 
        * which can be demonstrated by 
            * gps, cellular data of the driver
            * measurement of the vehicles
                * calculus: time is  = speed (can estimate speed)
                * Ms. Woodfield would have had "infinite time"
                    * based on road conditions, to complete an overtake.
                    * the moment Ms. Woodlfield assumed the passing position. 

* tl;dr - no possible situation with this crash telemetry, using site
measurements, that vehicles in those positions where the drivers insurance
in the improper lane position is not responsible. Any statement to the 
contrary is simply false or lacks those material facts / situational 
awareness. 

So I'm suggesting that EV requests the other drivers cell phone data
(and we provide analysis); and that Geico could, as legally be entitled
to request that data or to extract it from the other vehicle. 

The rental car company may have this telemetry data as well (but since 
her car wasn't hit; they probably didn't keep it). We don't need it;
but a video simulation is important step in understanding what happened.

Cell data is best -- we can see if the driver was distracted, or texting.
At this stage; with proper phone analysis i.e. "does the Geico app track
this information"; what information do we know about the other person?

If her insurance isn't going to pay; then Progressive needs to involve her. 

I love that about Australia, if you're texting and in an accident
it's always the texting persons fault, just like the speeding
persons fault, the reckless drivers fault, missing a stop sign 
on a school bus.  Regardless; there is a human cost to those 
decisions and fortunately everybody walked away unharmed. 
Montana is such a lovely state; we are requesting a pre-arbitration
meeting (un-arbitrated, but recorded) in Summer to discuss this matter. 

The purpose of the insurance regulatory framework operates is to 
behave as an reasonable disaffected intermediary between the parties,
hopefully Geico, Progressive, et al. all see this as
opportunity to engage in a constructive dialogue with EV about 
our mutual interests in a resolution to this matter.  

The Airstream is part of an R&D initiative related to other business
matters; and we may seek additional damages as it pertains to engagement of 
professional services if this matter is not resolved.  At this point 
EV is still focused on the salvage of the limited edition artwork inside
of the Airstream, as they pertain to CyberStream development.  The loss
in value to us has been significant due to it's fabrication style. 

I appreciate you do not want to accept blame, assuming we can't convince
you to work with us - what are the next steps in your process? 
(or does denying the claim terminate your responsibility in the matter?)
Please review. 
 
Federal NTSHA safety rules clearly state that licensed drivers 
must maintain awareness of the vehicles and surroundings around them. 
"Rules of the Road" that are codified in a Federal Safe Driving standard
as both drivers were out of state.   This situation was "by the book"

Because Ms. Woodfield had just passed a long commercial vehicle and
moved ahead to maintain safe distance in order to return to the slow 
"truck" lane; this is not optional on her part. 

She was signaling intent to return to the lane (with no intention 
to illegally stay in the passing lane),  achieved a safe distance 
to return to the truck lane and then proceeded with the maneuvere.

The word is "impatience". 

In legal terms this means Ms Woodfields position was "reserved" as designated
by the rules of the road, and relevant statuatory signage throughout
the state. 

Road rules clearly state Ms. Woodfield must return to the truck lane.
Ms. Woodfield towing a unlaiden weight of 7,400kg aluminum riveted 
trailer is not allowed in the passing lane except to pass, 
(which had been done)
and she is required to follow the law and return to the "truck lane"

As such .. Ms. Woodfield has no responsibility beyond a failure to 
recover from an unplanned maneuvere as she was in the process of
compeleting a safely executed manuever, and the resulting crash 
occurs due to a car being "out of position". 

^^^ we need to concur with the officer confirming this.  

The maneuvere reserved the lane for Margaret as soon as she was in the 
overtake position (passed the first truck).  Textbook Autonomous Driving.
If our auto-pilot system did what their driver did; we'd absolutely
be fault!!  accepted responsibility and was cited. 

Vehicle and celluar data (if reviewed) will indicate that
the faulty driver was performing an illegal passing maneuvere -- on
the incorrect side of the road; and would indicate the vehicle
positions. I believe witness statements about lane position also 
concur with this.  

According to this statement of fact, it would mean that if Margaret
had plowed into the other driver, and that
the action chain which followed is therefore not the other drivers
fault. [51% the primary responsible party]; so just to make that clear
Geico only accepts responsibility if their customer gets hit, but 
alas that is simply not accurate in any insurance context I'm aware of.

EV designs Autonomous systems and #human life, is very important
to us; as party of our commitment to employee safety. Attempting
to avoid the accident is always the proper decision, and sets a 
very dangerous precident for a future with autonomous trucks. 
You wouldn't want us designing our software to drive like the 
Geico driver and then NOT being held accountable? It's absurd.  

While the EV vehicle was piloted by Margaret at the time of the 
accident - no auto-pilot system, if an auto-pilot system had
inference engaged.  The faulty driver was practicing "blind passing" 
which was both dangerous and irresponsible and that behavior 
is 100% of the cause.  Textbook case of "illegal lane position"

If there had been a collision, between two vehicles it is important 
from the perspective to attribute fault. 

This feels like a textbook case of engineering, or explaining math
which is never a good idea.  
But back of napkin calculus tells us that we can calculate 
the time between the lane change; and the drivers speed -- 
Ms. Woodfield was using the proper signalling to the overtaken
truck when the Geico driver was in improper lane position. 

Mathematically speaking Ms. Woodfield had "infinite time" as the lead 
vehicle to complete her passing manuever safely once she
had moved into the lead position. "No passing in the slow lane"

I prefer cellular data; it's easier to prepare a 3d video to
demonstrate.  No version in time or space that this was not Geico
drivers responsibility as the state regulated insurer for the 
driver at fault.   

I further maintain that not knowing the contents of the other vehicle.
The best approach was to avoid the accident - not "plow into her"
Internal review says no fault to Ms. Woodfield; null notation
in employee file "it happens; let's just get it fixed".

We will be working with the remaining
parties to provide analysis and plan to pursue full remuneration the 
accident from Geico, plus professional expenses for the analysis.

3d models are expected to be rendered in another two weeks (backlog)

EV is requesting Geico consent, discovery requests will be incoming.
We will be requesting celluar GPS data from your driver for review
and will be sending you a copy. 

EV has preliminarily engaged legal counsel. It is our intention
to work with them to demonstrate Geicos responsibility. 

The approximate vehicle length of the truck and trailer 
is:
 * 23ft 7m tough Airstream Flying Cloud 23d carvan
 + ~0.5m ball hitch 
 + nissan frontier 2015 king cab (5.2m)
 + the midpoint: ..
    * ^^^ irrelevant; improper lane position.

There is a well known blind spot in this area surrounding any 
long vehicle, that is why the rules of the road state that passing
must be performed in the appropriate passing lane.  

This was dangerous; and could have cost my partners their lives.
EV is committed to raising awareness about lane positions and
improving sensor awareness "trailers with sensors" 
in an attempt to salvage our Unit.  We are inviting Geico to
participate and a plan is forthcoming. 

This position is reinforced with driver safety warning and signage
throughout the great state of Montana.

EV maintains the position that the lane was ours according all relevant
statutory decisions pertaining to the matter.  Geico is the primary 
responsible party.  We are working on a salvage plan as well which 
should be less expensive than totalling - it would be EV's preference
to proceed with the assumption that Geico is responsible.
