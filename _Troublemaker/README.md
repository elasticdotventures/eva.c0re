/purpose HOWTO: study, and learn to create Effective adaptively intelligent "AI" learning communication sales & marketing channels. In short; the pursuit of 💰:booty: (Yei:@EV like 🏴‍:pirates: 🤣!)

# 🏴‍☠️ eva.c0re is a Slack-inspired task bot instruction grammar-syntax 

1️⃣ Hi, I'm @b (alias "R0ck1t" or "🚀") architect of @eva the elastic.Ventures "EV" bot 🤖
2️⃣ Also; Welcome to [_Troublemaker/README.md] 😁. Please let yei know how much syntax yei want. 

// status: .. @henk @pietro looking for content, does your website get any traffic?  

!todo @b #troublemaker can make some far out stuff. #noBadIdeasK? #whyDoYEINeedToBuild.this();

## Welcome to #troublemaker

💀 Yei are invited to join the EV slack at 
http://elastic-ventures.slack.com 


## Goals

🚀 @henk EV is internally doing a http://coda.io pilot; requesting Yei'r & #human @pietro into that. 🤔👍👎🤷

## Repo Goals
Status: 🙏 for content Dumps 
^^^ Please add links; 🌧🌈

### Near Term Repos
* Create a documentation plan; organizational command & metric "coordination" syntax for TM outreach
* This is public; this repo should map all public facing "Troublemaker" partners; sources of authentication.
* map of documents which can be hacked (collaborated) "byei" (by YeI @b @henk)
also establish a set of metrics (such as google analytics; and ultimately others #dataphiles) 
as a baseline for performance of various marketing initiatives // interest 
ELI5 collaborate on specific wording & presentation of offerings 
discuss who has ability to edit // create new content

#### Software/Site/App/Bot Goals? 
🚀 10,000 memberships - via smart automation
🚀 develop requisite software tooling
🚀 @henk how to pay? 
🚀 @henk how to track members? 
    * who has memberships? links for members.
🚀 @pietro Existing MRR / signups, cancels, etc.
    * 
🚀 @pietro What internal process already exists?

# EV & Troublemaker 'big picture' plan

/eva !important "💀"  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vZF6ZNXWjMjn3sqBDb9aHpj1nhssbz7rjBUNkzi5dVY/edit#

## Next steps
🚀 establish metrics and then let's find our overlap of competencies;
what information is public "free" and who controls that?
what are the penalties for copying? 
alternative ways to monetize content might actually be on advertising/content for sites
i.e. https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18660344/firefox-subscription-paid-service-vpn-cloud-storage-release-date

EV is offering to assist TM in it's organizational software planning strategy &amp; business execution.

## Next steps
🚀 establish metrics and then let's find our overlap of competencies; 
documentation for GrowBot will be in here;  
how can we design something in the open and still own the product?  (I don't care; let's do it anyway)
what information is public "free" and who controls that?
what are the penalties for copying? should we address these now or later?  
"what is the incentive to design" if it will just be copied.

💀 EV directors certify ISO9000 software compliance six-sigma narrative ; 
b-corporation renewal and sustainable initiatives given preference #ubuntu:cake:.  #compliance

🌈 #Ubuntu is part of yei organization. Yei all share the same h1ve. EV reserves 10% of yei revenue for various charities. #:50% going to #human initiatives; and 50% going toward better free education, open software, and scientific advancement

#### Why? 
As EV see's it; there are virtually no possible outcomes where !copycat strategy is not successful; 
provided !copycat can 'cherry pick' products.  Yei'd like to sell those products and introduce them into 
the offerings at/in retail stores worldwide. 


Version of widescale electronic device manufacturing that does not efficiently utilize Chinas strengths.
Business done in China that runs through taobao, etc. is insufficient for efficient manufacturing "at scale".

### Strategy
I would broadly like to think of TM as my "office in Shezhen"; a place
funded by recurring revenue and giving access to engineers.

### Recruiting
Broadly speaking; the universal income approach "royalties" model that 
TM is currently offering could be dramatically enhanced by an 
organizational incubator; helping people standardize their Strategy
planning, goals.  

I would prefer to offer these projects on a case by case basis until I can understand the deal stream.
But ideally we're collectively "scouting" certain types of science, engineering and business students to form "teams" to fix the planet.


Upon presentation of a working prototype (of any sort) we would provide
automated sales tooling and organizational connections for Mechatronic 
Engineering students connecting them a "virtual co-founder" offloading 
certain development tasks and simplifying distribution of software; etc. 


## Desktop, Browser, &amp; Solo or Meeting Voice Controls
🚀 I use \\=.example;;\\ as the syntax in my browser. The EV intention is to create an intellisense version in Visual Studio Code with a predictive algorithm; sort of how like gmail writes responses; as well as offer audio escape for both siri, alexa, google home, and in conference bots; TroubleMaker meeting room is http://meet.jitsi.org/elastic-ventures/troublemaker and the bot is there to greet new people; but it can also interact directly with them and actually manipulate the entire user interface (rewriting itself) based on the yei language, accessibility, data privacy, authentication, etc.
