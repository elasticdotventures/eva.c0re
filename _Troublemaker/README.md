/topic @eva.c0re info

🚀 @eva is "Elastic Ventures Assistant" or "Emoji Virtual Assistant"; a tool for tech savvy business technology automation language for #humans 🧑 and bots 🤖 tutorial; found at http://github.com/elasticdotventures/eva.c0re/_Troublemaker/README.md syntax guide. Part #human; part 🤖 - perfect for yei who intend to transition to cyb(o)rgs; or groups ... cyberOrgyeis 🤣🤖🍆💦🤖🍑 #sorryNotSorry #crudeDadJokes

🚀.💀 warning: this is also high speed synaptic installer 😐😐😐😐... so, erm .. well, 
hopefully this doesn't crash =.currentUser();  🙏🧠😁. 👉🙈🙊🙉. 🚧👇  #compliance

💡 Vocabulary: Yei, yEi, yeI  
* 🐥 Yei means "Elastic.Ventures" EV Automation; with you and I.  
* 🤓 Syntax; tone practice.  Capitalization y=flat tone; Y equals high tone. 
* yei collectively is you + eva + "I". 
* Yei means mostly "You"; Y+ei which means "us". 
* yEi means mostly @Eva the "Emoji Virtual Assistant🤖"; in this with y+i "us, You & I"
* yeI means "I" the author; with you and @eva automation "us" 
* "yei" is you, i, us, in both present and future tense. 
* yei'r is a contraction of yei+are or "the hive is now" 
* *yei is any operating person or process in the Hive. 
* YEI is the entire hive-mind; You and I inclusive 🤝👍 
* YeI is mostly You and I; with the rest of the hive crew as backup.
* YEi is the lonelist since I am excluded or at least less involved "You all" 
* Phonetically "Yee" like "Yeehaw Cowboy" 🤠 it is synonmous with "EV" (or Elastic.Ventures)
* A poem to Yei. How I love EV; by at 🐝;  

😎 Yei Cool? Next Steps
* yei will use this syntax to introduce new fresh #human brains to the #troublemaker hive. 
* @eva will provide access to a variety of knowledge; collectively referencing the knowledge of humanity.

🤯 Don't Panic!
Yei will not be expected to know anything.  It's cool; Yei are part of yEI and yei're gonna get this done. That's how yei work; as a hive. 

💀 #gdpr eva.c0re/_Troublemaker is operating on top of the EV 'hive mind' infrastructure; which in turn uses services from provided by cloud:aws cloud:azure cloud:google ; vendors:[_services.md] & techstack:[_techstack.md];

In addition Yei are parsing syntaxes from several systems:
* eva.c0re slackish slack.com  
* coda.io business process #ops
* github.com commit logs 
* wechat 

/topic 💀 adopting syntax; organizational compliance - how much is too much? 
* yei is important as EV introduces intelligence amplifying "IA" bots into our cloud hardware infrastructure.
* the #human brain is fragile; enhancement is inevitable yei have designed @eva to operate machinery such as medical devices in Yei or a 💖🙈🙊🙉🐵 #human so please consider that.  syntax is important. so is security; learnmore:#cyberpunks 
* the robots run on a component system called an "Effective"; "Effect Action Syntax" for interactive presentation "tutorial". See [src/Effective.npm] with plans for hardware interface in [_General/#prototypes].

💀 ^^ this is a toolchain for my own brain implant (vr "space" helmet) join:#prototypes 🙏always checkout the channel README.md before participating in a channel. warning:#dildonics &amp; lubricants ahead! 🤣🤖🍆💦🤖🍑 

💀 EV is also manufacturing; but an important part of any project is the documentation and syntax. 


🍰 🙏🙏 need website content // what & how can yei contribute? please contact .=EV.slack(`@b`)

!todo @b #troublemaker can make some far out stuff. #noBadIdeasK? #whyDoYEINeedToBuild.this(); 
// what is everyei doing on the day to day? who has time to help build the AI+IA map .=thisChannel();
🤣:"🍕" 



* this guide is my first attempt at a tutorial; so please bear with me as I explore some of the syntax.
* the IA has the ability to translate all content on the page; enabling a variety "easter egg" behaviors  effects to adapt the content make the system more or less playful based on the engagement||interaction by the user. i.e. micro-games (ai v player1) for displaying content Components i.e. "Effectives"

/topic 🤓Effectives
* a simple of an Effective might be after a period of time the system attempts to 'restart' engagement, but also keeping local context of the interaction history in both the client and server.
* progressively loading the content based on sections (with lookahead using a graphql + graph object database)

😲 What Yei will learn
* !commands alias a maps a word,gesture, to emoji, i.e. todo, 
* "action to emoji" with positive reinforcement 🍰 protocol; (explained here: [_General/Cake.md]) 
* the goals, scope, etc. are later in the document
* as well as a bit about EV culture. 

🚀.🤘 yei is your word of the day. it means you with EV technology @eva 🤖. 
=.👢();

=.ReadyPlayerOne()?

# 🙉🙊🙈 
@eva !say Welcome currentUser() 
```eva test:failok
!alias 
    currentUser() as:Yei()      // ~scope is slightly different Yei is You (with us; future tense); currentUser() is {{PlayerOne}}; by yourself; present tense. 😆
```
🚀.🤘 when yei'r  (you+we are) done; this will all make sense. 

# How to tell yEI to do stuff.
!todo @b ^^ no grok test. 😉   //  👈 add a task to @b's todo list; priority 1 "immediate", :confused:
!!!todo @b .Sleep() 😴💤   //  👈  add a task to @b's todo list; priority 3 "low" ☕🤣

💡 the more bangs (exclamation marks) !!! in a command or instruction the slower (or lower priority) it will be performed slower.  yes, it's written that way on purpose. please be polite; .=@eva say Yei will get cake. 🙏🍰

🤓 @eva the "Emoji Virtual Assistant" is IA and processes emoji as both action and metric. 
Emoji is a highly-symbolic emoji driven language, but in this sense Emoji is used in a pictographic format similiar to Chinese; but Emoji offers more color and easier pattern visualization and recognition.

# What are "Memes
* There is no .=version();; 
Yei expect the same syntax will be compatible with a variety of upcoming brain machine interfaces .=!todo copycat;  and provides many stimulating streams for virtual reality environments. 

Popular !commands are aliased to an emoji to summarize "normal interactions" and help distinguish command severity.  As such the !alias command is highly advanced jedi 
wizard neo-in-the-matrix type powers; but yeira N00b (new player); and #sorrynotsorry Yei gotta grind some basic syntax first. 

😎 BUT this is cool - so !command/s could also be aliased to a sound or gesture within video or audio contexts, such as a group meeting.  The @EVA command language itself is highly extensible and trainable; built on an slack-irc chatroom mentality; the goal is offer phonetic "dialects" of phrases including chinese, dothraki, klingon, or wookie-ish phrases .. eventually; for now .. yei're writing a lot of documentation and test cases. 
but that is the goal. 🙄 Please 🐻 with yeI(). 

🤓 this message came from the README.md [_General/README.md] for the #Troublemakers slack; and _Troublemaker github to help TM define goals using @eva as a series of discrete steps which could be a funnel, a treasure map, a playbook -- whatever; just some instructions. We will streamline delivery with automation; provide tests.  In this tutorial yei'll dive into specific syntax really quick and then come up for air.  

.Continue({👍:🙈🙊🙉++, 👎:#troublemaker, 😕:#wtf})? 



💡 Elastic.Ventures offers elastic "intelligent automation" organizational infrastructure; 
this tutorial is a guide for @henk and @pietro which 🚀 is hoping YEI can hack on. 

😍 The goal is to roll up "playbooks" of common tasks for both staff and members at TM and provide "at a glance" summaries of activity inside a project. Continually improve user experience.  #eva.troublemaker 😉

🤓 In windows the EMOJI keyboard can be accessed WIN+; (semicolon) then type the command.  Yei can use !command blocks or an emoji alias; that's Yei choice. Sometimes !command syntax is clearer, the !command blocks will probably be mapped to emojis for visualization; this is a new language - not suited for everybody. @eva syntax is for writing bot instructions; i.e. the "how could this be better" type thinking. 

👆 In that sense; each one of these text blocks is part of the tutorial. by the way; this section is chained to the section above it; if you're not looking at the source code you hopefully 🙏 just saw a cool text transition. 🤣 In that sense; we're going to be doing a lot of inline document stuff which EV will need troublemaker @pietro and @henk and probably others in the #troublemaker organization to coordinate.

🚀 Yei could use a bridge to wei-chat; and some review on the Chinese documentation.
🚀 I'm asking somebody on your side to help me provide sales tooling for your membership offering included things like market membership cards with QR codes.  
🚀 Mapping out staff introductions; guru network; competencies, availabities (calendar sync etc.)
🚀 Trying to figure out how hard it would be to sell 100,000 memberships via bot .. 
🚀 To that extent ^^ if there are other yei running on other hives who are also working on that goal; yei'd like to meet them. back to the tutorial. 

🤓 In the interactive mode; if you made it this far you've probably been asked if this was interesting? 
🛑 Hey, is this content interesting? If it's not interesting please let @b know; trying to train people how to explore tooling available.  

🚀 EV is discussing providing an electron windows overlay; but the interface is effectively command line style and can be embedded anywhere. The core is designed in node.js so it will run as a browser plugin; or in the cloud but there are already many amazing emoji plugins -- this is the teaching guide for "under the hood" so yei can develop a mental model how @eva works.  #eva.emojihelp

```eva
!alias
    .hint() as:`🤓`      // :nerd: hint, or useful "helpful" background (if yei'r interested, .join #eva_bot to experiment making @eva do things)
    .eli5() as:`⭐`      // :star:  explain "concept" like i'm 5 (simple words; high level concept)
    .topic() as:`🌈`     // :rainbow:  the conversation thread // channel topic (things inside 
    .concept() as:`💡`    // :lightbulb: a definition or key take away; the "purpose" or "goal"
    this file)
    .study() as:`👀`     // :eyes:  let's look at this; it's a 'popUp' or something to learn or review. usually has links to more detail. 
    .eva() as:`🤖`       // :robot: emoji is ~samesame as ```eva or /eva commands 👇
    .say() as:`🦜`       // :parrot: interact with currentUser() as @eva (or any yei)
    .warn() as:`💀`      // :skull: important warnings, #safety, #governance
```

💡 once installed @eva commands are accessible everywhere -- slack-ish or IRC chat model to maintain "context" on a conversation or task or "topic";  Btw here's a link to the slack channel for Troublemaker https://elastic-ventures.slack.com/messages/CH9AN8VNH/details/

💀 An Electron app docked in Windows 10; that has an optional also a keylogger (with local configurable archive settings). EV're explaining what yei're going to install and ASKING what you'd be comfortable with? 

🤣 trust is such a precious thing. 

🤓 @eva Commands can be issued in any integrated software (and any software can be integrated//bridged). 

🤓 There is a soon to be published browser plugin which can enable any web based software "command mode" using an escape sequence you define; for now we'll just use emoji.  Right now we mostly use slack. Private commands start with a forward-slash "/" or bang "!"; also visual studio code.

⭐syntax with pictures is easier on #human brains (🧠❤ pattern matching) 
⭐emoji can also be aliased to sounds, words or gestures for enhanced accessibility.

## Goals

🚀 @henk EV is internally doing a http://coda.io pilot; requesting Yei'r & #human @pietro into that. 🤔👍👎🤷

## Repo Goals
Status: 🙏 for content Dumps 
^^^ Please add links; 🌧🌈

### Near Term Repos
* Create a documentation plan; organizational command & metric "coordination" syntax for TM outreach
* This is public; this repo should map all public facing "Troublemaker" partners; sources of authentication.
* map of documents which can be hacked (collaborated) "byei" (by YeI @b @henk)
also establish a set of metrics (such as google analytics; and ultimately others #dataphiles) 
as a baseline for performance of various marketing initiatives // interest 
ELI5 collaborate on specific wording & presentation of offerings 
discuss who has ability to edit // create new content

#### Software/Site/App/Bot Goals? 
🚀 10,000 memberships - via smart automation
🚀 develop requisite software tooling
🚀 @henk how to pay? 
🚀 @henk how to track members? 
    * who has memberships? links for members.
🚀 @pietro Existing MRR / signups, cancels, etc.
    * 
🚀 @pietro What internal process already exists?

## Next steps
🚀 establish metrics and then let's find our overlap of competencies;
what information is public "free" and who controls that?
what are the penalties for copying? 
alternative ways to monetize content might actually be on advertising/content for sites
i.e. https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18660344/firefox-subscription-paid-service-vpn-cloud-storage-release-date

EV is offering to assist TM in it's organizational software planning strategy &amp; business execution.

/join #thinking_culture
👀/ text is boring; #human brains process pictures much faster than words. 
puzzle solving increases likihood of retention. 
@eva is all about emoji .. @eva the emoji virtual assistant. /👀


💀 EV directors certify ISO9000 software compliance six-sigma narrative ; b-corporation renewal and sustainable initiatives given preference #ubuntu:cake:.  #compliance

🌈 #Ubuntu is part of yei organization. Yei all share the same h1ve. EV reserves 10% of yei revenue for various charities. #:50% going to #human initiatives; and 50% going toward better free education, open software, and scientific advancement 


!! @henk troublemaker.site status? 
🚀 ^^ EV can accept a delegation; @henk what files and content do you already have? 
🚀 ^^ EV 


#### Why? 
As EV see's it; there are virtually no possible outcomes where !copycat strategy is not successful; 
provided !copycat can 'cherry pick' products.  Yei'd like to sell those products and introduce them into 
the offerings at/in retail stores worldwide. 


Version of widescale electronic device manufacturing that does not efficiently utilize Chinas strengths.
Business done in China that runs through taobao, etc. is insufficient for efficient manufacturing "at scale".

### Strategy
I would broadly like to think of TM as my "office in Shezhen"; a place
funded by recurring revenue and giving access to engineers.

### Recruiting
Broadly speaking; the universal income approach "royalties" model that 
TM is currently offering could be dramatically enhanced by an 
organizational incubator; helping people standardize their Strategy
planning, goals.  

I would prefer to offer these projects on a case by case basis until I can understand the deal stream.
But ideally we're collectively "scouting" certain types of science, engineering and business students to form "teams" to fix the planet.


Upon presentation of a working prototype (of any sort) we would provide
automated sales tooling and organizational connections for Mechatronic 
Engineering students connecting them a "virtual co-founder" offloading 
certain development tasks and simplifying distribution of software; etc. 


## Desktop, Browser, &amp; Solo or Meeting Voice Controls
🚀 I use \\=.example;;\\ as the syntax in my browser. The EV intention is to create an intellisense version in Visual Studio Code with a predictive algorithm; sort of how like gmail writes responses; as well as offer audio escape for both siri, alexa, google home, and in conference bots; TroubleMaker meeting room is http://meet.jitsi.org/elastic-ventures/troublemaker and the bot is there to greet new people; but it can also interact directly with them and actually manipulate the entire user interface (rewriting itself) based on the yei language, accessibility, data privacy, authentication, etc. 

👀 Examples:
* For example "HEY EVA" .. command .. "THEN" .. action .. "AHEM;" .. wait (save context) .. "REPEAT" .. confirm .. "CONFIRM; MISCHIEF MANAGED" .. 😁 
* HEY EVA .. /topic #general duration 15 minutes invite @henk and @pietro .. THEN say "times up" AND  .. CONFIRM; MISCHIEF MANAGED
* HEY EVA .. start meeting topic .. UNTIL .. I SAY "EUREKA"; ..  MISCHIEF MANAGED
* HEY EVA .. TockIn /* Talk In */
