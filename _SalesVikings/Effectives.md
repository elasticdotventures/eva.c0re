How to interact with your digital assistant and define new commands.
Currently this is done in github; but in the future it will be possible 
to access via a drive; what I'm calling the "EVDrive" file format.

Channels mangage their own content; and the @eva effective syntax is 
shared between all channels.   The ability to give ourselves countdown 
timers has applicability to more than just meetings but also organizational
and note taking practices (which themselves are synergistic).  


Please see [_install.md] for information on getting the toolchain.



/topic ü§ìEffectives
* Effective's are both visual and non-visual components of a website.
  For example; a deadman "watchdog" component might wait until after a period of time the system attempts to 'restart' engagement, 
  but also keeping local context of the interaction history in both the client and server.
* progressively loading the content based on sections (with lookahead using a graphql + graph object database)

```


üëÄ programming in voice Examples:
with listener yei can turn any mic into a personal assistant. see [_Aiia];

```
* "HEY EVA" .. command .. "THEN" .. action .. "AHEM;" .. wait (save context) .. "REPEAT" .. confirm .. "CONFIRM; MISCHIEF MANAGED" .. üòÅ 
* HEY EVA .. /topic #general duration 15 minutes invite @henk and @pietro .. THEN say "times up" AND  .. CONFIRM; MISCHIEF MANAGED
* HEY EVA .. start meeting topic .. UNTIL .. I SAY "EUREKA"; ..  MISCHIEF MANAGED
* HEY EVA .. TockIn /* Talk In */ 

```

The macros and words themselves are definable; syntax becomes very important.  Syntax means the way something is spoken or what is 
commonly referred to as the SVO (Subject Verb Order) which can be used to measure any language. 

* this guide is my first attempt at a tutorial; so please bear with me as I explore some of the syntax.
* the IA has the ability to translate all content on the page; enabling a variety "easter egg" behaviors  effects to adapt the content make the system more or less playful based on the engagement||interaction by the user. i.e. micro-games (ai v player1) for displaying content Components i.e. "Effectives"
