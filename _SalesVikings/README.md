Trial #2:  speak robot on a company call;  
adopting"beep boop" to simply acknowledge another hive-node on a call; 
nothing too obvious --- but just a little bit faster.  

I'll try and show you on our next call.  

So don't be alarmed if you get the occasional "beep-boop" tones in our calls; 
fast+high for 'good/happy' (beep-boop!) and low for 'bad/sad' (beeeep-boooop) 
or low-high for question (beep-boooop?) ;   

Trial #3: 
I think we can develop some good hilarious tech lingo; 
maybe even get others to use it without knowing about 
#red_team (that would be the funniest imho). :wink::thinking_face:   
if other people hear us talking; 

if asked; yei must deny #red_team exists -- that's the most critical; 
even better if we can keep change the subject to #general channel 
protocols; obviously as independent nodes in the same hive we can 
help eachother out on this.  :smile:
