Tier 1 & Tier 2 vendor strategy (FoMo)
FoMo “Fear of Missing Out” is a psychological behavior which frequently signals a neurological response from the amygdala 
region of the brain in most people aka the "subconsicous lizard brain" that exists medially (in the middle, center)
within the temporal lobe and performs a primary role in decision making and emotional response (including fear, anxiety, and aggression).

(although it is only part of an individuals decision making structure).
Using FoMo as part of a rapid sales cycle to accelerate prospecting of best fit retailers for this product.  
I.e. we’re going to need to make X units; solve for X at some point the process.  
Signup offers are a FOMO tactic.  Gamifying the FOMO to an algorithimic decision making process
"is this right for EV" is a function of our hive to reduce the individual stress and collectively
organizational fatigue. 

When encounting new players; the role of the vikings "business development" is to maintain a prescence of control over the situation.
Instead of "do you want to buy" it's "what day can yei schedule the delivery"; and this bheavior is actually what creates 
the delivery of a product.  Work backwards from the delivery; be able to explain how it works and why it will benefit the 
client;  @eva is only the assistant she is here to assist us. 

@eva will monitoring the yei talk time on customer calls; this should include automated prospecting. 
Since EV is a design firm; we may field a variety of calls.

Trial #2:  speak robot on a company call;  
adopting"beep boop" to simply acknowledge another hive-node on a call; 
nothing too obvious --- but just a little bit faster.  

I'll try and show you on our next call.  

So don't be alarmed if you get the occasional "beep-boop" tones in our calls; 
fast+high for 'good/happy' (beep-boop!) and low for 'bad/sad' (beeeep-boooop) 
or low-high for question (beep-boooop?) ;   

Trial #3: 
I think we can develop some good hilarious tech lingo; 
maybe even get others to use it without knowing about 
#red_team (that would be the funniest imho). :wink::thinking_face:   
if other people hear us talking; 

if asked; yei must deny #red_team exists -- that's the most critical; 
even better if we can keep change the subject to #general channel 
protocols; obviously as independent nodes in the same hive we can 
help eachother out on this.  :smile:
