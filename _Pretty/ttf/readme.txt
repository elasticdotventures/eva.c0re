   is a complete alphabet, albeit all lower case at the moment, 
   based on the letters p, i, n, f, a, and r.

   Top Speed Version 1.41 is currently available as shareware.

                        ...about Top Speed...
   _______________________________________________________________

   Top Speed is strictly a display typeface, and should be used
   for no more than one line--preferably only one or two words--
   at a time.  The most distinctive feature of Top Speed is the 
   fact that all the letterforms are connected to each other.  
   To maintain this look, all the characters have tails.  The 
   forward-slash character (and underline character) can be
   inserted between words instead of using the space bar, 
   maintaining the continuous baseline.  The back-slash character
   is a somewhat shorter connector; the '|' key is a slightly 
   longer connector. 

   To begin your word or line of text, you should insert a small 
   version of the baseline, which is the "<" character.  This will
   start off your type with an appropriate "tail."  To finish off 
   your line of type, use the ">" character, as it will end your
   tail at the appropriate distance.  These characters are more 
   necessary in the Outline version of the font.

   Top Speed may require minor kerning adjustment with some
   characters.  Because each letter must be placed EXACTLY next
   to the following letter, (Top Speed Normal and Heavy are 
   slightly more forgiving) you might notice a sliver appear 
   between an occasional pair of letters.

   There are no differences in the capital letters except for the
   letter F.  The capital letter F does not continue along the 
   baseline, but instead it can run into certain letters 
   (typically, the a, o, or u) through it's horizontal crossed 
   stroke.

   The Outline version of the capital F contains an extra bit of
   black.  This fills up the "hole" left at the beginning of the 
   next character. If the capital F is used to end a word or 
   sentence using Top Speed Outline, that little speck will have
   to somehow be creatively covered up. 

   Top Speed is my first computer designed typeface.  It was 
   created completely in CorelDraw 7.  Since this was my first 
   font, I did stumble through the whole process a bit, and as
   a result, it does contain the odd imperfection.  For example,
   I am not sure how to get my apostrophes and quotation marks
   to work.  Currently, the null character is inserted instead.
   In a way, it's a bit of a handmade product.  I began the
   font in the spring, basically ignored it all summer, and
   then finished it in the fall.  Mostly, it has been fun.  
   I hope you enjoy it.
