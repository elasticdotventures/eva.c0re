RE: Recruiting. @tamara introduced the idea of organizational intrinsic motivation to #ops vocabulary.  It turns out that teams where one or more members demonstrate insufficient motivation causes loss of organizational efficiency suffers and processes break down.  
From my perspective - joining slack, uploading an avatar, downloading the github repo, seeing themselves appear on the corporate site are all important steps in the onboarding process that is being developed (using our own dog food ‘@eva’; then offering-selling-pairing our service competencies with others). For business development getting a phone provisioned, gmail (with avatar), email signature, and business cards all represent important parts of the onboarding process; and the faster yei can get that done the quicker yei can start reviewing the mindfulness #thinking_culture and that translates to what is individual role? why are yeI doing this?).  The key idea behind automation of the cards should foster a ‘self-service’ mentality within the organization,.
