Goals: An engineer or designers guide to the Law
by @b; EV 2019

Let's start with a nasty word: plagarism, or it's more extreme version "thief" and what constitutes 
theft of property, including intellectual property versus trespass.  The [ev-license.txt] when approached
as a legal construct. 

I'll briefly explain "WHY" naming conventions and word precision are important, because they define 
a style and provide a simple way to convey complex subjects to those who understand and use them. 

EV attempts to interject "humor" in our products and documentation to make them more engaging, 
and when these designs are implemented in software algorithms those markers are a signature 
to denote that it belongs to EV, even if derived from MIT. 

Some are obvious, some are hidden.  

EV practices "word precision" throughout technical and business specifications.  

With new ideas it means defining or "inventing" a new word to reference an abstract concept.  
In the example above there are two vocabulary words:
* eimjip : the language our devices speak.

ðŸš€ It is better to make up a silly word; or pattern to simplify searchability, it also makes the 
google++; identifying first use of a term or word. 

For example; if a design is not understood then programmers use a generic interface 
specifications i.e. "_data" and don't bother to define new terms and use them consistently.  
Usually this comes from a lack of properly understanding the problem at the time of design. 

Trademarks are by far the easiest // least expensive // most 'common sense' and 'distinguishable'
form for law for judges and juries it's often "obvious", a trademarks cost $45/year and can created in 
a few minutes, often litigated for a few hundred dollars in legal fees by mediocre attorney, 
compared to patent which can cost $50k to file, and $2+ million to litigate.  International trademarks
cost a bit more (around $1200), and case-law has been used to protect the interest end luxury brands like
rolex, prada, etc. and so will we.  While I'm an "open-source proponent" I'm not a fan of somebody
ripping off large parts of our system and calling it their own.  Our protocols talk to our devices.
If you want to use our protocols, you will either pay us, or fall within our "acceptable use" policy,
which we may revise at our discretion.  The layout of eimjip is intended to provide fair-use.
