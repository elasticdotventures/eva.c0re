## convert() supported file formats (to SVG):
-s, --svg, -b svg, --backend svg
SVG backend. The output is a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file. This is a single-page, variable-sized, dimension-based backend. Note that unless the -r option is given, the resolution of the input bitmap is assumed to be 72dpi.

-b pdf, --backend pdf
PDF backend. The output is a file in the Portable Document Format. If the input consists of multiple bitmaps, they are each rendered on a separate page. This is a multi-page, variable-sized, dimension-based backend.

-b pdfpage, --backend pdfpage
The PDFPage backend is like the PDF backend, except that it is fixed-size like the PostScript backend.

-e, --eps, -b eps, --backend eps
EPS backend (default). The output is an encapsulated PostScript file. This is a single-page, variable-sized, dimension-based backend.

-p, --postscript, -b ps, --backend ps
PostScript backend. The output is a PostScript file. This is a multi-page, fixed-size, dimension-based backend. If the input consists of multiple bitmaps, they are each rendered on a separate page.

-b dxf, --backend dxf
DXF backend. The output is a file in the Drawing Interchange Format (DXF). In this backend, all Bezier curves are approximated by piecewise circular arcs; this is suitable for processing in CAD software or for machining applications using CNC tools. This is a single-page, variable-sized, pixel-based backend. The -u option has no effect for this backend.

-b geojson, --backend geojson
GeoJSON backend. The output is a file in the format used by some applications processing geographical data. In this backend, all Bezier curves are approximated by 8 straight line segments. This is a single-page, variable-sized, pixel-based backend. The -u option has no effect for this backend.

-g, --pgm, -b pgm, --backend pgm
PGM backend. The output is a portable greymap (PGM) file. It is a convenient backend for antialiasing a bitmap image. This is a multi-page, variable-sized, pixel-based backend. If the input consists of more than one image, the images are concatenated in the output.

-b gimppath, --backend gimppath
Gimppath backend. This backend produces output suitable to be imported as a path by the GNU Image Manipulation Program (Gimp) (in the Layers, Channels & Paths dialog, select Paths, then right-click and select Import Path). The output is actually an SVG file. The differences to the SVG backend are: the --opaque option has no effect, the --flat option is always on, and the dimensions are pixel-based. This is a single-page, variable-sized, pixel-based backend.

-b xfig, --backend xfig
XFig backend.
