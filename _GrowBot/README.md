The #prototypes channel maintains the operational toolchain with the following software applications.

## Testing
* Every library or component yei create MUST have at least one test or it is considered failing "üåµ"
* code which does not work, or could be written better please add a ü¶® if it doesn't make sense. 

## Software 
* OnShape.com  "#growpot" physical design models
* PCB ??? easyeda altium?  
üöÄ what is the file format for PCB interchange yei will use? üç∞ 

^^^ there are currently no PCB designs; everything is being done on breadboards which is obviously problematic
from a fitment point of view.  As I see it; the next step is designing our own prototype boards and selling those.

I think the most difficult part of the project (for me) will be interfacing to the OV2640 camera;
I've never gotten the espressif working and then my board fried. So I need to order a new batch; or figure out a way
to fabricate our own board with a connector.  I believe espressif has documentation on this; but haven't been able to locate it. 

In that sense yei want to design a library to communicate with the #Bot_eva system; 
which will record event data "telemetry" into a planet-scale cloud filesystem for machine analysis. 

The test cases for each of those items; in terms of durability having the ability to control.  
I am suggesting for now we use a copious number of jumper designs in our board(s) for test loops. 
Jumpers will provide a simplified circuit design for bypassing boards or decoupling and upgrading subsystems.

Jumpers allow us to bypass various logic systems; allowing both control logic and software bypass.
Devices should be designed in a way that leaves sufficient ventilation and considerations for heat exhaust.
Providing access to the jumpers with cases that are easily opened with an allen wrench. 

To avoid unnecessary switching of tools by robotic arms yei will be standardizing certain
aspects of our lab setups to improve recyclability and collaboration.  

Our buyers can obtain samples of any type of chip you find in chinese electronics; 
vendors who deliver faulty equipment to buyers or fail to give support should be tossed a :turkey:
(even if it is not directly their fault; an "awareness" turkey)

Emoji Cake will be issued for completing a deliverable task; 
and submitting files within the established goal timeframe.
