# A gentle introduction to cyber-w0rm (bot) coin farming. 

The concept of "farm" is used; as well as biology 
"darwinism" evolution of the species. A farmer will let their
best above baseline bull (male) breed with the best above baseline heffer (female).
this is called "Selective breeding";
Using a selective breeding; A large farm; or group of farms "hive" 
might take the top 10% and trade them; and the bottom 10% is sent 
for slaughter.

We are selectively breeding w0rms that look for 🍰 "profit";
and 🍰 can also be modelled more abstractly as "dopamine". 

💦 means a "pool"; or "blend" (transformation?)

The _PwndK01nz 

w0rm is the basic building block of our AI trading bot; a grumbull
(3 or more) designates a quorum is reached.

A w0rm inherits a brain (eventually; with ancestorial knowledge)
The w0rm is given a series of data vectors; broadly speaking these
are patterns that represent causal relationships in data.

The brain is a series of logic gates; similiar to electronic circuits.
Each emoji represents a discrete action in the state machine; that
can be visualized by enabling and disabling the display of those
subsystems (or be prepared to have a hot GPU in your primary machine)

Axiom (statement of truth) - In an open market; Lots of sellers; price moves down; Lots of buyers price moves up. 

💀 ^^^  true? always. yes. it's an axiom. 
The axiom does not say "it must do this specific move"; the market is considered stochastic in that it's state cannot be modelled.  If we can accurately predict Weather patterns; based on pressure; we can take any complex market and quantity it into a series of pressures.

There are actually words to describe "the market" which is bulls and
bears 🐻 bears want to buy.  bulls 🐂 want to sell for profit creating 🍰  (getting a 🎯);   The bullseye function indicates cake was generated (in the simulation).

Cake is a represented as a factor of N 🎂🍰 "cakyei" represents
deviations. The long term goal is to color code the frosting on
the cakes based on their internal state.  A bot which has 
🎂 will be able to survive a bot with 🍰; 
each one representing a tiny profit; that the 🐬 "purpoise" 
see [Purpose_🐬.js].  Ultimately; we're seeking to maximize 
🎂 -- to continue operating "please insert coin player 1";

The EV organization receives 10% tax on all dividends; for 
operational expenses and cybersecurity.

Organizationally the hive intends to operate at an actual cost 
basis well below 1%; returning the additional ~9% toward both 
business development and exposure through charity opportunities "outreach". A failure to tithe 10% may result in a shadowban;
or bad advice sufficient to generate the profit.  

A sentient neuron is one which is able to contribute 10% to 
the common good.  

black dots ⚫ indicate substandard performance. 
A screen of  can see that as game over); lots of turkeys; 
turn into black dots -- the random player is constantly 
"stochastically" emitting button pushes; but it's vote
will be less; using a meta-binary classifier. 
in laymens terms: with neurons "Majority" rules; that's
why being part of a "grumbull" (pile of neuronii) that 
agree is so important.  That is how organic intelligence
systems operate; with verticies and edges (or "call states"
in AI parlance) to other neurons (logic subsystems) they must collaborate with. 

🤓 our farm uses emoji pictures along with a label "text 
identifer"; it's easier for #human brains to remember with 
pictures.  future iterations of this interface will have a 
BMI (Brain Machine Interface);  associating those with 
emotions and feelings during the course of the training 
protocol.  Getting "cake" will feel good; "Yay; booty; spoils
of war; reward recognition" and the winning teams get to 
keep winning; while the losing teams are retired. 

# How Grumbulls work
!we want to have some type of sort (need to study); 
.top() takes optimal; .pop()

# Simulation/ what? 
We are recording historical market data to start our bot; "as soon
as the historical data is loaded"; then time is 'fast forwarded'  (each 60 second period); and three or more parallel processes are 
spawned for parallel timescale analysis of the same data.  The bot
is living in the present; guessing the next right move. 

There is another player; that is also running.  It is making
random movements.  

🤓 examples of timescales include 👶linear, polynomial, and 
🐚fibonacci, np 


timeseries depth 12   (how many samples we are using);
timeseries layer
🐚 fibonacci / golden ration 1+2+3+6+12 ... 	weight score. 
💻 binary , exponetial 1+2+4+8+16+32 ..
👂 linEAR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
👶 human 1min, 5min, 15min, 60min, 3hr, 12hr, 24hr,  48hr, 72hr, 96hr, 120hr, 144hr


The reponses
are 



Within those oscillations; there are patterns; that follow 
such as 'e', or golden ratios ultimately seem
to appear.  What we are doing is following the curves in the data;
looking for where "classical patterns" intersect.  

There is a tendency once something is winning; for it to stay winning.
The challenge is balancing the processing power; and security of a
massive system against what could be very small rewards; for 
anticipation the "point of inflection" on a wave "trend line" where 
it inverts.  By broadly looking at markets; and EVENTUALLY studying
the other w0rms "collaborating" as well as the historical patterns of individual players on an exchange (those who appear frequently); 
and also historical events; news feed (twitter) sentiment analysis. 

For the reference yei (the EV hive) is using BTC-USD as our two
currencies.
    🍰####  bitcoin
    💰####  usd   (but represents global world markets)
    
🤓 ^^^ emoji-symbol + number; ~ is a transformation. 

To further extrapolate; this is a "matrix esque" emoji symbol;
ecosystem of reactive state machines that are collaborating 
on specialized risk balancing/mitigating system.  The format 
itself has applicability in processing neural circuit diagrams
as they are running.  

🤓 ^^^ #Human_🧠 are MUCH faster at pattern matching; allowing
us to tune the model(s) and track other models.  The ultimate 
goal is to design a system with a brain that can rewire itself
what yei will call a "positronic" brain; operated by digital 
state automata -- this pattern can be broadly be applied to 
different services; as part of the EVA framework as part of our
goals in creating "IA" (intelligence amplication)
"sentience"; hopefully with sufficient
training to observe and mimic complex organisms (dogs, monkeys,
humans) in a multi-sensory non-harmful way.  

BTC "bitcoin" vs. "USD" US dollars is the data-stream we will
attempt to regress.  

School of AI; Siraj made a demo with code to build an AI trading
bots.  There are certainly lots of poorly "procedurally" written bots; 
in the market; "descents" the bots movements may appear stochastic; but by analyzing signatures such as activity patterns (is it running in cron?); our bot can gain additional confidence; in AI this is either an "addition" or a "multiplication" operator; more likely
this will be a human player; they will be easier to protect. 

🦃 turkey move; is a move that does not return a profit; so 

Turkeys "eat" cake; they will eventually take over the screen.
The porpoise needs to find the cake BEFORE the Turkeys eat it.

# AI Fundamentals; vocabulary
gradient : a numerical representation
sigmoid :


# YETI
(like SETI) the search for extra terrestrial life -- is
yei goal to identify our own moves; the moves of our friends.



We are taking the winner(s) of a round; and 

This emoji metric set; by assigning factors such as:
* size : "strength of signal"
* transparency : confidence 
* dangerous creatures (emoji);

A minimum stack is 3 three processes:
redis_ : a hot emphemeral (not permanent) storage; 
    - install and run on localhost:6379
[coinbase_⚽.js] 
    - firehose : consumes the coinbase public feed []
    - reducer  : converts to timeseries data
    - verifier : uses market data
